> I apologize to those of you who use the `HCUI` versions of the themes as you will have to set it up again due to the name change.

- [`Theme`] Added `Hearthstone` theme color.
- [`Theme`] Contrary to what I said about the `Opal` sub-theme, and tanks to configuration arrays reworking,  I decided to introduce the `HCUI` version for it too. Obviously the theme will reflect the characteristics of the standard `Opal` sub-theme, but, possibly, with a proportionally greater readability on monitors that do not comply with the `sRGB` standard and/or at a resolution lower than `FullHD`;
- [`Development`] Introduced handling of font rendering problems;
- [`Development`] Improved `Previews Control Monitor` (Console Log Monitor) messages output in `JS` and `PHP` engines;

- [`Readme`] Found a little mistake that involving my `Table o Contents` generator: `GitHub` and `Visual Studio Marketplace` not uses same method to `hash bookmarks`: offline, in `VSCode`, `MD preview` seems to behave like `GitHub`, but once published, no: when `README.md` showed in preview or in Extension Documentation or on GitHub, bookmarks works correctly, but in the same version, in Marketplace, some bookmarks not working (those that have some particular characters that GitHub replaces each with a `-`, while Marketplace replaces all those sequential with a single `-`): - e.g.: # **All work [ and no play ] makes Jack a dull boy**: - GitHub / Markdown Preview on VSCode » `#all-work---and-no-play---makes-jack-a-dull-boy`; - Visual Studio Marketplace » `#all-work-and-no-play-makes-jack-a-dull-boy`;
